manglik-aashish:
  name:     Aashish Manglik
  bio:      Associate Professor, Departments of Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Anesthesia
  fullbio:  "Aashish was an undergraduate at Washington University in St. Louis, where he worked in the lab of Jeff McKinney on Salmonella-host interactions. He moved to California in 2008 to join the Stanford Medical Scientist Training Program. There, he worked with Brian Kobilka as a graduate student to elucidate different aspects of GPCR function, resulting in a number of important contributions to our current understanding of opioid and adrenergic receptors. After finishing his medical training in May 2016, Aashish began his independent research career as the first Stanford Distinguished Fellow at Stanford University School of Medicine within the Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology. He subsequently began as an assistant professor at UCSF in fall of 2017."

billesboelle-christian:
  name:     Christian Billesbølle
  bio:      Postdoctoral fellow
  fullbio:  "Christian hails from Denmark, where he received a bachelor's degree in Pharmacy and a master's degree in Human Biology at the University of Copenhagen. He conducted his graduate studies in the lab of Ulrik Gether, where he studied the mechanism of the prototypical transmembrane transporter LeuT by new spectroscopic methods. Christian spent a year in the laboratory of Jonathan Javitch as a visiting Bikuben research scholar. After a short postdoc in the lab of Hans Bräuner-Osborne's lab, Christian decided to come to the states. In the Manglik lab, he is examining the structural and biophysical basis of iron transport with support from the [Alfred Benzon Foundation](https://www.benzon-foundation.dk/)."

faust-bryan:
  name:     Bryan Faust
  bio:      Graduate student, Biophysics (joint with Cheng Lab)
  fullbio:  "Bryan grew up in southern California before his undergraduate studies took him to UC Davis for a BS in Biology, completed in 2013. Between UC Davis and UCSF, Bryan spent 5 years in the biotech industry at Genentech and Abbvie Stemcentrx. There, he worked in protein chemistry, biophysics, and antibody discovery roles at the Scientist level, tasked primarily with the biophysical characterization of discovery- and lead-level antibody-drug conjugates for the targeted treatment of cancer stem cells. At UCSF, he is a joint student between the Manglik and Cheng labs where he is using cryo-electron microscopy to uncover the structural basis of both canonical and patholgoic signaling states in GPCRs mediating diverse biology ranging from nociception to maintenance of central metabolism."

harrison-simone:
  name:     Simone Harrison
  bio:      Graduate student, Biophysics
  fullbio:  "Simone received her bachelor’s degree in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry from Wesleyan University in 2018. At Wesleyan, she worked in the Olson lab to study the biophysical properties of novel pathogenic proteins from the genus Vibrio. After college, Simone worked for 2 years at Vanderbilt University in the Chazin lab as a Research Assistant, studying the structural basis of nutrient sequestration and inflammation mediated by S100 proteins, and aiding with protein production. In the Manglik lab, she is studying the molecular details of the interaction between GPCRs and GRKs, as well as the mechanism of GPCR mediated regulation of the hedgehog signaling pathway."
