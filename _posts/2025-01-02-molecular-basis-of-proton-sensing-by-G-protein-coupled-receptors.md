abstract: "Three proton-sensing G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)—GPR4, GPR65, and GPR68—respond to extracellular pH to regulate diverse physiology. How protons activate these receptors is poorly understood. We determined cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of each receptor to understand the spatial arrangement of proton-sensing residues. Using deep mutational scanning (DMS), we determined the functional importance of every residue in GPR68 activation by generating ∼9,500 mutants and measuring their effects on signaling and surface expression. Constant-pH molecular dynamics simulations provided insights into the conformational landscape and protonation patterns of key residues. This unbiased approach revealed that, unlike other proton-sensitive channels and receptors, no single site is critical for proton recognition. Instead, a network of titratable residues extends from the extracellular surface to the transmembrane region, converging on canonical motifs to activate proton-sensing GPCRs. Our approach integrating structure, simulations, and unbiased functional interrogation provides a framework for understanding GPCR signaling complexity."
